ðŸ“„ DVLD Management System
The DVLD Management System is a Windows Forms application built using a 3-tier architecture to streamline the management of users, drivers, and driving license applications. Designed with maintainability and scalability in mind, the system integrates several advanced features to ensure a dynamic and secure user experience.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
3-Tier Architecture: Separation of concerns across UI, business logic, and data access layers.

Event-Driven Workflows: Ensures responsive and dynamic UI behavior based on user interactions.

T-SQL Triggers: Enhances security with automatic handling of sensitive operations like password management.

Persistent Login: Utilizes the Windows Registry to retain user login state securely between sessions.

User & Driver Management: Full CRUD operations for managing individuals and license applications.

This project showcases the use of structured design principles in a real-world administrative system and can serve as a strong foundation for more complex desktop applications.
